      2. Site
    </h4>
    <p>
      As part of the Site, Residual Token provides access to a decentralized
      finance application (“Application”) on the Ethereum blockchain or other
      blockchain protocol, that allows lenders or borrowers of digital assets
      (“Cryptocurrency Assets”) to transact using smart contracts (“Smart
      Contracts”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the Residual Token Protocol may require that you pay a fee, such as
      gas charges on the Ethereum network to perform a transaction. You
      acknowledge and agree that Residual Token has no control over any
      transactions, the method of payment of any transactions, or any actual
      payments of transactions. You must ensure that you have a sufficient
      balance to complete any transaction on the Platform before initiating such
      transaction. By using the Site, you agree to pay all applicable fees
      charged by the Company or third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that Residual Token has no control over any
      wallets holding digital tokens, the method of payment of any transactions
      or any actual payments of transactions, and that Residual Token also has
      limited control over transactions on the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Residual Token disclaims all warranties, express or implied,
      related to your use of the Site and you accept all responsibility for your
      choice and usage of any digital token wallet. Further, you must ensure
      that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens
      stored at your Residual Token compatible wallet address (“Cryptocurrency
      Wallet”) to complete any transaction on the Platform or the Ethereum
      network before initiating such transaction. Although Residual Token tests
      and utilizes MetaMask, a software cryptocurrency based wallet to interact
      with the Platform, your use of Metmask or any other digital asset wallet
      is also on a caveat emptor basis.
    </p>
    <h4 class="terms-content__title">
      3. Relationship of the parties
    </h4>
    <p>
      You agree and understand that nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to
      constitute, create, imply, give effect to, or otherwise recognize a
      partnership, employment, joint venture, or formal business entity of any
      kind; and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be limited to
      those expressly set forth herein. Except for the indemnity provisions
      herein, nothing expressed in, mentioned in, or implied from these Terms is
      intended or shall be construed to give any person other than the parties
      hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect
      to this Terms to enforce any of its terms which might otherwise be
      interpreted to confer such rights to such persons, and these Terms and all
      representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and provisions hereof
      are intended to be and are for the exclusive benefit of you and us.
    </p>
    <h4 class="terms-content__title">
      4. Access to the site
    </h4>
    <p>
      Access to the Site is provided “as is” and “as available” basis only. We
      do not guarantee that the Site, the Platform, nor any content on it, will
      always be available or uninterrupted. From time to time, access may be
      interrupted, suspended or restricted, including because of a fault, error
      or unforeseen circumstances or because we are carrying out planned
      maintenance. To access the Site, you must have the necessary equipment
      (such as a smartphone or laptop) and associated telecommunication service
      subscriptions to access the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to limit the availability of the site to any person,
      geographic area or jurisdiction we so desire and/or to terminate your
      access to and use of the site, at any time and in our sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you stake tokens on the Platform you may be permitted to use your
      staked tokens as collateral to borrow other tokens. You may borrow tokens
      equal to a specific collateral factor, which is represented and described
      as a percentage of the current value of your staked tokens (the
      “Collateral Percentage”). Each token (borrowed and/ or loaned) may have a
      different Collateral Percentage, and we reserve the right to set the
      Collateral Percentage for any token and adjust an existing Collateral
      Percentage up or down, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time.
      We will provide you with notice of such changes to the Collateral
      Percentage with thirty (30) days’ notice, and such notice may be posted on
      the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may suspend or disable your access to the Site if we consider it
      reasonable to do so, e.g. you breach these Terms.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that the Site and your use of the Site contain certain
      risks, including without limitation the following risks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        that any Smart Contracts you interact with are entirely your own
        responsibility and liability, and that Residual Token cannot manipulate
        your Smart Contract;
      </li>
      <li>
        at any time, your access to your cryptocurrency assets may be suspended
        or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your
        cryptocurrency assets which may result in the cryptocurrency assets
        diminishing in value or you being unable to complete a Smart Contract;
      </li>
      <li>
        if you are a borrower of cryptocurrency assets and if your collateral
        declines such that your collateral is no longer sufficient to secure
        your borrowed cryptocurrency assets, other users may seize your
        collateral to close out your borrowed cryptocurrency asset balance;
      </li>
      <li>
        and site and/or application may be suspended or terminated for any or no
        reason, which may limit your access to your cryptocurrency assets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You further acknowledge and assume certain risks associated with the
      purchase and sale of Tokens from third parties and your use of the Site,
      including without limitation, the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control
        and dispose of Tokens stored in your Cryptocurrency Wallet. Accordingly,
        loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or
        vault storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any
        third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by
        gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use,
        may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions
        caused by or otherwise related to your Cryptocurrency Wallet or vault
        you choose to receive and store Tokens in, including your own failure to
        properly maintain or use such Cryptocurrency Wallet, may also result in
        the loss of your Tokens. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely
        the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving Tokens, including,
        for instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving Tokens,
        or provides an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the
        loss of your Tokens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because Tokens and the Residual Token platform are based on the Ethereum
        protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum
        protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform or Tokens.
        Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the
        development of quantum computing, could present risks to the Tokens and
        the platform, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining
        services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism
        that underpins the Ethereum protocol. This condition applies to Platform
        products written using other protocols.
      </li>
      <li>
        As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum
        protocol, Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of
        validating Tokens transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including,
        but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks,
        and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the
        platform and Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution
        and recording of transactions involving Tokens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
        interfere with the platform or Tokens in a variety of ways, including,
        but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
        consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing.
        Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software,
        there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may
        intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core
        infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the
        platform and Tokens, including the utility of Tokens for obtaining
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges,
        such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no
        regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or
        manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe
        an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital
        or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions,
        Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to
        insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there
        is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer
        recourse to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        The regulatory status of Tokens and distributed ledger technology is
        unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict
        how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with
        respect to such technology and its applications, including the Residual
        Token platform and Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or
        whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law
        and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its
        applications, including the platform and Tokens. Regulatory actions
        could negatively impact the platform and Tokens in various ways,
        including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination
        that the purchase, sale and delivery of Tokens constitutes unlawful
        activity or that Tokens are a regulated instrument that require
        registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the
        parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. The Company
        may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory
        actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in
        such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary
        regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own
        tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in
        adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income
        taxes and tax reporting requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that
        utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the platform
        and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the
        Residual Token services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to
        the Residual Token platform or the Company, all decisions involving the
        Company’s products or services within the platform or the Company itself
        will be made by the Company at its sole discretion. These decisions
        could adversely affect the platform and the utility of any Tokens you
        own, including their utility for obtaining services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transactions on the blockchain involving digital assets may be
        irreversible and accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental
        transactions may not be recoverable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to
        the risks included herein, there are other risks associated with your
        purchase, possession and use of Tokens, including unanticipated risks.
        Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or
        combinations of the risks discussed ins these Terms.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Accordingly, you expressly agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You assume all risk in connection with your access and use of the Site,
        Tokens, the Application and the Smart Contracts;
      </li>
      <li>
        You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining
        the nature, value, suitability and appropriateness of these risks for
        yourself and that the Company does not give advice or recommendations
        regarding the Tokens or the Site, including suitability and
        appropriateness of, and investment strategies for digital assets/Tokens.
        You agree and understand that under no circumstances will the operation
        of Site and your use of the Site be deemed to create a relationship that
        includes the provision of or tendering of investment advice.
      </li>
      <li>
        That you expressly waive and release Residual Token from any and all
        liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any
        way related to your use of the Site, the Application or the Smart
        Contracts. These Terms are not a disclosure of all risks associated with
        the Site or the Tokens.
